# Apocolypse-Food-Prep-Analysis
This project was created as it branched off from a tutorial project I had started my PowerBI journey from. Utilizing the knowledge from the tutorial, I created my own columns and transformed data utilizing Power Query to create visualizations.

The context behind the dataset is that the information is taken during an Apocolypse. People are rushing to buy survival items, and that especially includes food. The attributes in the dataset include Buyer ID, Product ID Purchased, Total Purchased, State, Age, and Customer ID.

More TBA.
